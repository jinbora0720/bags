rbag(
  coords,
  n_partition,
  breaks_partition = list(breaks_easting = NULL, breaks_northing = NULL, breaks_time =
    NULL),
  directions,
  z = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{coords}{matrix of coordinates with \code{n} rows and \code{d = 2} or \code{d = 3}
columns for spatial or spatiotemporal data, respectively.
Columns should be in the order of easting, northing, and time.}

\item{n_partition}{integer vector of length \code{d}. Each element corresponds to
the number of intervals each coordinate axis (e.g., easting, northing, time)
is divided into.}

\item{breaks_partition}{list of break points in each axis. If specified,
coordinates will fall into bins between given break points in each axis.
For instance, 5 break points will render 4 partitions.
\code{breaks_partition} supersede \code{n_partition}, if specified.}

\item{z}{character vector of length \code{prod(n_partitions)}. Each element is
one of "W", "NW", "N", "NE", "E", "SE", "S", and "SW" which represents the
true direction at each partition. If unspecified, it is fixed at "W".}

\item{params}{list of true parameter values.
\code{tau_sq} is a nugget.
\code{sig_sq} is a partial sill.
\code{a} is a temporal decay, \code{c} is a spatial decay, and \code{kappa} is space-time
interaction in a stationary nonseparable spatiotemporal covariance function
\deqn{cor(w(l), w(l + (h,u))) = exp(-c||h||/(a|u|+1)^{\kappa/2})/(a|u|+1)} in
\href{https://doi.org/10.1198/016214502760047113}{Gneiting (2002)}.
\code{beta} is regression coefficient(s) of size \code{p}.}

\item{seed}{seed number}
}
\value{
a data frame is returned with
\item{coords}{coordinates by \code{easting}, \code{northing}, and \code{time}
along with partition information.
Partition information includes row index (\code{row}), column index (\code{col}),
discretized time index (\code{time_d}), and \code{partition}.
\code{partition} is in the format of "\code{row}, \code{col}, \code{time_d}".
For spatial data, \code{time} and \code{time_d} are set at 0 and 1, respectively.}
\item{y}{sampled outcome \code{y}}
\item{w}{sampled latent process \code{w}}
\item{X.i}{\code{i}th column of a matrix of size \code{n x p}
generated independently by \code{rnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 0.1)}.
If \code{p = 1}, then simply \code{X}. Returned if \code{beta} is specified.}
